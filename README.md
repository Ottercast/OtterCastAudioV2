## How do I get one?

~We are currently planning a small batch production run, stay tuned.~ No we are not, sorry

You don't want to wait? You can of course run a small batch on your own! Please have a look into the [production folder](/production_v2.1.1), a batch size of just 5 (and up to 30) boards is supported by JLC.

## Installation & Configuration

After [downloading and flashing](https://cast.otter.jetzt/docs/firmware/#download-ready-made-images) the image, OtterCastAMP can either be configured via the `config.ini` file or via the web-interface.

# Notes

All production files are optimized for [JLCPCBs SMT service](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote?orderType=1). The gerbers are located in `OtterCast_combined-v2.1.zip` and as for the BOM and position file please refer to `BOM_v2.1.csv` and `POS_v2.1.csv`.

Please choose `1.6mm`, `impedance control`, `ENIG`, `Specify order number location`, `SMT Top side assembly` and `tooling holes added by customer` as board options. 

The `BOM_v2.1.csv` does not contain all parts, since JLC does not sell all parts. Please refer to the following list for the manual assembly parts.

Or [jump to the Images section](https://github.com/Ottercast/OtterCastAudioV2/blob/main/production_v2.1/README.md#jlc-images) of this README to see how to order the boards.

If you can't select the layer sequence, try changing the *Layers* to 6, then back to 4. For some reason, it sometimes doesn't load correctly on JLCPCB's website.
